# CSS Flexbox Layout Module
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

* Block, for sections in a webpage
* Inline, for text
* Table, for two-dimensional table data
* Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

## What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
It uses the **@media** rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

## Example
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

`@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {` <br>
  `body {` <br>
    `background-color: lightblue;` <br>
  `}` <br>
`}`
